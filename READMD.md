### Week 1
Welcome to Machine Learning! This week, we introduce the core idea of teaching a computer to learn concepts using data—without being explicitly programmed.

We are going to start by covering linear regression with one variable. Linear regression predicts a real-valued output based on an input value. We discuss the application of linear regression to housing price prediction, present the notion of a cost function, and introduce the gradient descent method for learning.

We’ll also have optional lessons that provide a refresher on linear algebra concepts. Basic understanding of linear algebra is necessary for the rest of the course, especially as we begin to cover models with multiple variables. If you feel confident in your understanding of linear algebra, feel free to take a break or help other students out in the forums.

### Week 2
Welcome to week 2! I hope everyone has been enjoying the course and learning a lot! This week we’re covering linear regression with multiple variables. we’ll show how linear regression can be extended to accommodate multiple input features. We also discuss best practices for implementing linear regression.

We’re also going to go over how to use Octave. You’ll work on programming assignments designed to help you understand how to implement the learning algorithms in practice. To complete the programming assignments, you will need to use Octave or MATLAB.

As always, if you get stuck on the quiz and programming assignment, you should post on the Discussions to ask for help. (And if you finish early, I hope you'll go there to help your fellow classmates as well.)

### Week 3
Welcome to week 3! This week, we’ll be covering logistic regression. Logistic regression is a method for classifying data into discrete outcomes. For example, we might use logistic regression to classify an email as spam or not spam. In this module, we introduce the notion of classification, the cost function for logistic regression, and the application of logistic regression to multi-class classification.

We are also covering regularization. Machine learning models need to generalize well to new examples that the model has not seen in practice. We’ll introduce regularization, which helps prevent models from overfitting the training data.

As always, if you get stuck on the quiz and programming assignment, you should post on the Discussions to ask for help. (And if you finish early, I hope you'll go there to help your fellow classmates as well.)

### Week 4
Welcome to week 4! This week, we are covering neural networks. Neural networks is a model inspired by how the brain works. It is widely used today in many applications: when your phone interprets and understand your voice commands, it is likely that a neural network is helping to understand your speech; when you cash a check, the machines that automatically read the digits also use neural networks.

### Week 5
In Week 5, you will be learning how to train Neural Networks. The Neural Network is one of the most powerful learning algorithms (when a linear classifier doesn't work, this is what I usually turn to), and this week's videos explain the 'backpropagation' algorithm for training these models. In this week's programming assignment, you'll also get to implement this algorithm and see it work for yourself.

The Neural Network programming exercise will be one of the more challenging ones of this class. So please start early and do leave extra time to get it done, and I hope you'll stick with it until you get it to work! As always, if you get stuck on the quiz and programming assignment, you should post on the Discussions to ask for help. (And if you finish early, I hope you'll go there to help your fellow classmates as well.
